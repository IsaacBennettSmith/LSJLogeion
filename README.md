# LSJLogeion
This is the heavily edited local Chicago version of the Perseus LSJ; all Greek converted to Unicode; 
many entries split or merged. 
If using these files, please credit Perseus Tufts *and* Helma Dik/Logeion, and please report issues. 

Perhaps a few words about edits to these LSJ files are in order. The changes made are typically to 
reflect the actual text of the dictionary, missed by original data entry. In a few rare cases, changes 
made in the various Supplements are incorporated. Changes are not made to split entries up where the original
had a single entry, except in the case of οἶδα, which I decided to (also) make available as a separate entry.

Despite the many incremental changes over the years, close reading of just about any entry will reveal that more
can be done. Corrections very much welcome!
